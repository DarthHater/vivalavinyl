# Viva La Vinyl

### Background

Viva La Vinyl currently runs on pgBoard and it's making my life a living hell. Let's change that. The aim with this new version of VLV is to:

* Get off of Apache as a webserver
* Use a more modern stack
* Use a language and database that will allow more developers to contribute (hopefully)
* Don't reinvent the wheel, use frameworks rather than create our own

With that in mind, this reincarnation of VLV is using:

* Trails.js
* MongoDB
* Angular2
* Typescript
* Gulp

### Setup

```
clone repo
npm install
npm run typings install
mongodb
npm start
```

Open up your browser to http://localhost:3000 and you should see the homepage
